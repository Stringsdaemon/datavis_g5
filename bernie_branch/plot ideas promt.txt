"Hey Assistant! I need help coding one of the 10 Google Play Store visualizations below using the google_clean_v2.csv dataset. Hereâ€™s the context:

Dataset Columns:
App, Category, Rating, Reviews, Size, Installs, Type, Price, Content Rating, Genres, Current Ver, Android Ver, Last_Updated.

Visualization Ideas:

Category Rating Battle Royale (Compare rating distributions of 2 categories).

Time-Traveling App Popularity (Heatmap of installs over time).

Price vs. Rating Paradox (Scatter plot of paid/free app performance).

App Size 'Sweet Spot' Finder (Beeswarm plot of Size vs. Installs).

Content Rating Demographics Explorer (Stacked installs by audience).

Update Frequency Tracker (Calendar heatmap of app updates).

Genre Popularity Race (Animated racing bar chart of genres).

Free vs. Paid App Gladiator (Radial chart comparing metrics).

Android Version Compatibility Map (Treemap of app compatibility).

Review Sentiment Volcano (Volcano plot of Rating vs. Reviews).

My Request:

I want to build Idea #[Number] (or "[Name]").

Preferred tools: [Plotly/Altair/Matplotlib/Streamlit Components].

Specific needs: [Dropdowns/Sliders/Animations/Data Aggregation Steps].

Please provide:

Data preprocessing code (e.g., handling NaNs, filtering, date parsing).

Streamlit widgets for interactivity.

Visualization code with annotations.

Tips to optimize performance (e.g., caching, large datasets).

Example troubleshooting: [Mention any issues you anticipate, like encoding errors or missing data]."
